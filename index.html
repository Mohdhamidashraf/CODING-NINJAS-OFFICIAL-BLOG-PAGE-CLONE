      &nbsp HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language. Basically, it's the "code"
      behind every webpage _ even this one.<br />
      If you're just beginner to learn HTML, Let us tell you that it's a fairly
      easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do anything<br />
      more than setting a layout, draw a table, or creating frames - but it is
      handy as it helps you to structure the content correctly,<br />which is
      important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

      &nbsp However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
      to full-fledged web development. Various tools <br />easily eliminate the
      HTML coding from your work process - but if you want to be in to full
      control of your web-page, you'll<br />
      need to have some command over HTML

      Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A
      tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any <br />item on your HTML
      document. Tags tell what magic 1s to be done on the content a enclosed by
      them
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at two types of tags:<ol type="1"><li>  < tag-example 1 >. I need a closing tag< tag-example 1 ></li><li>< tag example 2 > I don't need a cloding tags.</li></ol></p>
    <p>In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and the second one is called the <br>closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
        commonly used examples of such tags are < html >,<br> < head >, < body >, < strong >, etc
    </p>
    <p>The second example tags about loner tags - as in, they don't need a closing tag to function. Although it's not required, these type of<br> tags are often written as < tag/> to make the debugging of code easier.
        to 1 Common examples of such tags are < hr/> - used for<br>horizontal line, < br/> - to break the line, etc.</p>
